## Getting to the Corn Exchange

By now you should know how you're getting to Cambridge be it by train, coach, car or horse.
The Cambridge Corn exchange is about a 20 minute walk from the train station. For details on
directions, parking and cycling please see the [directions page for the Corn Exchange](https://www.cambridgelivetrust.co.uk/cornex/venue-info/directions-and-parking-0){target="_blank"}.
We have a [map](#map) just below on this page which will give a little more context.

## Hardware

The hardware table just in front of the stage will have all of the bits and pieces
that you need for a hardware hack while it is open. Check out [hardware.mlh.io](hardware.mlh.io){target="_blank"} for details on what you can get.

## Food &amp; Snacks

Snacks are available regularly at the back of the hall, please help yourself. You can find hot drinks upstairs on the mezzanine on the right side. Meals are served at meal
times throughout the event, and will be announced to make sure you get fed.

## Emergencies

In the event of an emergency, please note the UK emergency phone number, **999**.
If you need to leave the building (e.g. for a fire), please leave the building promptly
through the nearest fire exit. Do not pick up your laptop or hardware hacks or swag.

## UIS Workshops

Our workshops are held in the UIS rooms, where the WiFi system is different. Before you go, please get a ticket number and password from our [WiFi page](/wifi) (you will need your Hack Cambridge ticket reference). Once at a workshop, you will need to connect to UniOfCam and enter the details you obtained from the WiFi page.
