              <p class="body-text">
                When you apply to the event, we collect information about you from
                MyMLH that is necessary for running the event, including your MLH ID,
                first name, last name, date of birth, email, phone number, institution,
                study level, course, shirt size, dietary restrictions, and any special

                process, we also collect your CV and your submissions to the questions
                we ask, including information about your interests, and the country
                you are travelling from. We also store your RSVP status and your

              <p class="body-text">
                We use this information for running the hackathon, which involves
                sharing it with trusted third parties. For example, we share
                anonymised data about your dietary requirements with those
                helping us with catering. We also use this information for
                sharing anonymised aggregate data with media organisations
                for the purposes of promoting Hack Cambridge.

              <p class="body-text">
                It would not be possible to organize Hex Cambridge without the help of

                However, we will not share anything else from your application with

                We will take photos throughout the event, and publish them. You may appear
                in some of these photos. We aim to publish photos that show people at their
                best, but if you see a photo of you that you dislike, let us know so that
                we can try to remove it. However, be aware that it is difficult to
                completely erase a photo from all media channels.
              </p>
              <p class="body-text">
                We will publish the names of winners and the winning hacks. We may
